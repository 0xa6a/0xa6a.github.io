I had my first IELTS test last month. Here is the result:


| Listening | Reading | Writing | Speaking |
| :-------: |:-------:| :------:| :------: |
| 7.5 | 8 | 6 | 5 |


So, writing and speaking are my weak points. This time I hadn't spended much time preparing for writing and speaking tests. Actually, 6 is beyond my expectation. My expectation for writing was 4~5 before I handed in the answer sheets. Surely, I could have done better had I practiced more. 

Speaking is soooooo hard for me. Even worse, I have no idea how I can improve. I am at loss.

However, I'm not frustrated. I'm still enthusiastic about English. It helps me in so many ways.

I have decided to post as frequently as I can **in English**. I hope I can be more proficient in writing and speaking.
