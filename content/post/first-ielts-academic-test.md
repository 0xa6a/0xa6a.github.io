I had my first IELTS test last month. Here is the result:


| Listening | Reading | Writing | Speaking |
| :-------: |:-------:| :------:| :------: |
| 7.5 | 8 | 6 | 5 |


So, writing and speaking are my weak points. This time I hadn't spended much time preparing for writing and speaking tests. Actually, 6 is beyond my expectation. My expectation for writing was 4~5 after the test. I'm think I can do a better if I practice more. 

Speaking it soooooo hard for me. Even worse, I have no idea how I should practice.

Anyway, I have decided to post as much as I can **in English**. I hope I can be more proficient in writing and speaking.
