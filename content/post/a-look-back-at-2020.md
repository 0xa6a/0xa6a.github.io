2020 was tough for many, and for me as well.

A couple of days ago, in December 31 at night, I finished the brief review of my 2020 and sent it to Ts, a friend I met on a hike back in 2017. Ts would then make it part of the yearly collection of reviews. There would be about 40 of them, all collected from his friends. This has been sort of *tradition* for a few years.

Soon afterwards Ts replied:

"What's you keyword for this year?"

"Anxiety", I replied without hesitation, which shocked me immediately.
